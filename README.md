## VI_discretized_TO

This repository contains the code for Trajectory Optimization using Variational Integration

to achieve high accuracy aerial maneuvers on legged robots. 
Examples on other dynamical systems
are also provided.

### Matlab Toolbox 
- Symbolic Math Toolbox
- Simscapte Multibody
- Simulink

### Code structure
- Each example includes
  
   (1) main.m file to run TO

   (2) getStruct.m to get the tree structure of the robot/ system
 
   (3) animate.m to simulate the optimal solution

- Simulink Models consists various simulated dynamical system by Simscape

### Note
- Set path: add with subfolder to SimilinkModels to initialize system parameters and functions
